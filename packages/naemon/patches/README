0002:
    The file include/utils.inc.php includes config.inc.php by going up 
    one directory in the physical directory tree. This patch changes that
    behaviour in a way needed for OMD: It is including the site specific
    config file /omd/sites/###SITE###/etc/ngaios/config.inc.php. The site name
    is extracted from the script file name (supplied by Apache).

0010:
    This patches fixed the problem to jump back to the start page
    whenever you press F5.

0017:
   This patch removes a check in the configuration validation that complains
   when there are no hosts or services. That way OMD does not need a dummy
   host anymore but can start plain without any host or service. The cgi-bins,
   Thruk and Multisite do not show any problems. Nor does the Nagios core.
